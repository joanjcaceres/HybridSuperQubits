## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Anaconda is installed. If not, you can download and install it from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download).
- Git is installed. If not, you can download and install it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Installation

### Using Anaconda and environment.yml (Recommended)

1. **Install Git**

    If Git is not already installed, you can install it by following the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

2. **Choose a Directory for the Project**

    Open Anaconda Prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

    ```bash
    cd path/to/directory
    ```

3. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/joanjcaceres/Fermionic-bosonic-qubit
    ```

4. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

    ```bash
    cd Fermionic-bosonic-qubit
    ```

5. **(Optional) Rename `environment.yml`**

    If you wish to give the Conda environment your own name, you can edit the first line of `environment.yml`:

    ```yaml
    name: your_custom_name
    ```

6. **Create and Activate the Conda Environment**

    Create a new Conda environment from the `environment.yml` file:

    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```

    Activate the environment. Replace `your_custom_name` with the name you specified, or use the default name if you didn't change it:

    ```bash
    conda activate your_custom_name
    ```
